# MINISHELL

This is a project by 42, which require us to utilize C language to craft a sophisticated shell, akin to the functionality of a Bash environment. This project required us to rewrite 6 built-in command such as echo, cd, etc. We even completed the bonus part of the project which required us to handle the '||' and '&&' operator.

# Usage
```bash
1. git clone git@github.com:NEIL-smtg/minishell_playground.git
2. cd minishell_playground
3. make
4. ./minishell
```
